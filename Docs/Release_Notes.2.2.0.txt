v2.2.0 (12/29/2009)


* Added Linux support.

  LibUsbDotNet supports linux via the linux libusb v1.x driver.

* Updated UsbDevice.OpenEndpointReader and UsbDevice.OpenEndpointWriter
  members to first lookup the endpoint descriptor for the current
  configuration.

  If an attempt is made to open an endpoint on a unconfigured device
  (GetConfiguration = 0) an exception is thrown.

  If an attempt is made to open a non-existent or invalid endpoint an
  exception is thrown.

* Added endpoint descriptor information to UsbEndpointBase class.

  A New property, 'EndpointInfo' is available from the UsbEndpointBase
  class.

* Depricated UsbGlobals class.

  The UsbGlobals class has been rendered obsolete and will be removed in
  future release. Update your code you use the UsbDevice class instead.
