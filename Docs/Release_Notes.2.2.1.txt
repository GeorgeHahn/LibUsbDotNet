v2.2.1 (01/13/2010)


* Fixed Bug ID: 2930836 - [OSX PPC] GetDescriptor request fails.

  On big-endian platforms, the descriptor type and index bytes are
  reversed.

* Fixed Bug ID: 2927179 - Wrong versioning. LibUsbDotNet 2.2.0 all
  AssemblyInfo.cs contains [assembly:AssemblyVersion("2.1.0.13")]
* Updated Benchmark application: Removed all calls to Control.Invoke.

  The benchmark application now uses a timer control to periodically
  update the display instead of "Invoking" an update everytime data is
  transferred. This provides a more accurate benchmark reading as well as
  a work-a-round for Mono .NET runtimes on platforms that do not properly
  implement the Control.Invoke method.

* Removed LINUX compiler option.

  The LINUX compiler option is no longer used. LibUsbDotNet (v2.2.1 and
  above) is fully platform independent.
